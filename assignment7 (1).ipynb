    "It allows us to create more general and simplified representations of real-world entities.\n",

    "Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes or interfaces that define the contract and provide a common interface for related objects or classes.\n",

    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data together in a single unit called a class.\n",

    "Encapsulation helps in data protection and prevents direct access to the internal state of an object, enforcing controlled access through methods.\n",

    "\n",

    "In this example, BankAccount is a class that encapsulates the account details and operations. The internal state of the account (account number and balance) is encapsulated within the class, and external access is provided only through defined methods such as deposit(), withdraw(), get_balance(), and display_account_info().\n",

    "The abstraction is not explicitly shown in this example, but it can be extended by introducing an abstract class or interface for the BankAccount class.

This abstraction allows us to work with multiple bank account classes interchangeably without worrying about their specific implementations.\n",
